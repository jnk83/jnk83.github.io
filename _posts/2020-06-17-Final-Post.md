Data Science Boot Camp has fortuitously concluded but will be missed - a great yet truly challenging three months

-----

It is with a heavy heart but also a relieved one to be wrapping up the Metis Boot Camp.  I don't think I've ever had so many extended periods of prolonged consciousness in my entire life.  I've certainly lost a few years of life down the road, but that's future me's problem.

My Final Project utilized a retail transactional dataset, and I used the K-means algorithm to perform a customer segmentation analysis.  The other projects were for the most part supervised models, so it was an interesting change of the pace.  I arrived at four customer segments and really enjoyed interpreting the different clusters, and running the algorithm through multiple cluster sizes.

Marketing analytics is one of my favorite areas of applied data science, and I hope to pursue additional projects like this one in the near future.

To everyone out there, I hope you are healthy and safe.

***Wishing everyone the best,***
