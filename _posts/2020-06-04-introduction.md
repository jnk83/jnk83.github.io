Data Science Boot Camp was fortuitously timed to coincide with the lockdown of America, thereby providing the undersigned with something to fully occupy his time.

When not occupying myself with data science, [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com), has once again become a chaotic stream of interesting volatility .  Otherwise, avoiding all major news sources is currently recommended.

When needing a brief update on the news, I stare out my window into the apartment opposite mine, where the middle aged occupant keeps his eyes rigidly glued to CNBC, Fox News, and somewhat curiously, Cosplay content.

I have wondered what he does for a living, as he does not appear to do any work in or out of the house.  It remains a mystery, but his constant presence is comforting in these isolating times.

A few things about getting into data science:
* [HackerRank](http://www.hackerrank.com) provides a great way to improve with python
* [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) is your best friend
* [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.com) will ressurect your math skills

Posts will improve with time (hopefully).
